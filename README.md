# Poke-guesser Bot

The Poke-guesser Bot is a discord bot which selects random pokemon and asks the user to guess the pokemon name. The bot automatically tracks the score of participating users. It also recognizes a number of admin commands, and player commands such as catching pokemon, and displaying the leaderboard. 

## Progress

This bot project is currently in progress. It is currently able to generate new pokemon, message the discord server, understand guesses, commands, and has a functional leaderboard. There are still a few kinks to be ironed out, including presenting the leaderboard in a nicer way, and adding functionality for the bot to operate in a single channel, and differentiate admin status or roles. 

## Background

This bot was built thanks to one of my friends, Pokketmuse, who reached out to me about this idea. She is a Twitch streamer who has a discord channel where she runs a few custom events for the users in the channel. One of these events is a Pokemon Guessing game she manually operated. In a nutshell, the game was to guess a daily pokemon, and the players were tracked on a leaderboard. Her goal was to practice convert this manual game into a bot, and to practice JavaScript at the same time.

I fell in love with this idea immediately. I have wanted to build a discord bot for a very long time. I also have wanted to apply my JavaScript knowledge for a while as well, but never had a good opportunity. This project gave me an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, so I got to work right away!

# Usage

# Technology

## Replit

We used the online IDE [Replit](https://replit.com/~) to program and run Poke-guesser Bot. Thanks to this service, this bot is able to run completely in the cloud, even if the browser session with Replit is closed.

## node.js

This project is written entirely using JavaScript in the [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment. 

## discord.js

All interactions with discord were handled thanks to the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library. 

## API

This bot would not be possible without [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). This API was not only easy to use, but provided a list of all pokemon, including their variants, as well as sprites that were instrumental in building this Poke-guesser Bot.
